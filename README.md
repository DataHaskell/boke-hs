Experimental bindings for generating Bokeh Graphs in Haskell. Project originally for Zurihac 2018

## Roadmap

 1. ~~*Safe* helper functions for inserting lines, possibly monoidal~~

 2. More models, particularly glyphs

 3. More helper functions for those models 

 4. Better file generation, plot composition

 5. Performace/Space efficiency optimizations, type-safety improvements. 
 
 6. As a subproject of the above, implementing the Python implementations of DataSource and DataSpec in a typesafe manner.
