Experimental EDSL for generating Bokeh Graphs in Haskell. Project for Zurihac 2018

##Roadmap

 1. *Safe* helper functions for inserting lines, possibly monoidal

 2. More models, particularly glyphs

 3. More helper functions for those models 

 4. Better file generation, plot composition

 5. Performace optimizations, type-safety improvements
